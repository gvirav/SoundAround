SoundAround allows you to see upcoming shows in San Francisco and listen to each band on the bill before you go.
There are currently mock shows as placeholders until the actual data is aggregated -- this is currently being worked on.
The Spotify API is used to allow you to listen to each band's most popular songs.
You must have a Spotify account to preview the songs.
